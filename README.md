# Blue
An easy first programming language! Check the Wiki for tons of detailed lessons!
Blue can be used to quickly and easily create graphics and games. You can create complex sprites that move around easily. Go to http://kiraprograms.com/blue.html for an online editor. If you want to use your own text editor but don't want to download anything more, include the following script at the top of the html:
```html
<script src="http://kiraprograms.com/blue.js"></script>
```
## Intro:
In every line, you will see a line of code. The first line of code will be run, then the second, then the third, etc.
We always end every line of code with a `;`.
