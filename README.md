# Blue
Many people learn to code using complicated programming languages that make it difficult to begin. Languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java, or C++ commonly require downloading lots of applications onto your computer and getting really technical right away. Creating graphics, user inputs (arrow keys, clicking), and other important game features requires even more overhead. With Blue, you can create games in just 12 lines of code that could take hundreds of lines in other languages. Blue allows you to create a complex game without having to know a lot of programming. It makes coding more fun and fulfilling even in the beginning! Since Blue is 100% in the browser, you don't need to download anything. It is also easy to compile Blue code into HTML, which can create a real, publishable website!

## How to Get Started
Blue is run in the online editor, at http://kiraprograms.com/blue. You can also run blue on your computer by cloning this repository. All of the information with tutorials, descriptions of code, and how to publish is on http://kiraprograms.com/blue/help.html.

## What is Blue?
